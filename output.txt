Node.js is an open-source JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code on the server. It enables asynchronous I/O primitives, making it suitable for handling multiple requests simultaneously. Key features include JavaScript across the stack, asynchronous programming model, fast execution, large community support, and cross-platform compatibility. Node.js is widely used for building RESTful APIs, microservices, and web applications due to its efficiency, scalability, and real-time capabilities.
